            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><strong><br></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><strong>BTIKA Angels' Club</strong></span><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2016, I joined in a social group started by my father and his friends called the "BTIKA Angels' Club", where once every month, we would visit various locations around the province of West Java to give donations, and our blessings to the less fortunate people living in those areas. We would usually visit 2 or 3 locations at each day of service, and eventually got used to the places and the people there as we would go on to return to these places several times.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; My father always told me that it is always better to give than to recieve, which is why he would always invite me to follow him to participate in these monthly activities with his group. Not only do I get to form good friendships with my father's friends' children, but I also obtain valuable lessons and experiences through giving to those who are less fortunate. I learnt that it is only through being grateful no matter the circumstances that you can have the willingness to give to others.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Blood Donation</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After turning 17 years old, my dad and I donated some of my blood in a local blood donation centre. Although I knew of what side effects of losing parts of one's blood may have on the human body, I was happy that I was able to open up my perspective on donating that we can not only donate physical subsatcnes such as rice, and flour, but we can also donate biological substances such as blood. Furthermore, it feels awesome that through giving some of my blood, I was able to save a life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Church-related Activities and Donations</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When I was a young child, I used to regularly attend various activities at my church. Most of these actvities revolve around the idea of gratitude, and the importance of giving from a young age. Occasionally, my entire church decided to donate clothes, shoes, backpacks, and other goods to a nearby orphanage, which we regularly visited. Whenever I visited the place, we would carry out various activities with the children in addition to giving the donations, such as singing, dancing, and various games.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to that, there were moments where my church visited an old folks' home. Most of the people who were there had little to no family members remaining, and the only people they had are the other elderly people living with them. The church would entertain, and enlighten the elderly by performing various songs, and spread the good Word of God. Once, my fellow church members and I helped swept clean the exterior of the premise.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">It gave me a strong feeling of happiness that I get to me a part of an event that would make these people happy and enlightened. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">I am thankful for being a part of these all these activitities not only for the fact that I can express my gratitute, but also the precious moral lessons I was able to learn from the work I volunteered in through the various organisations I was a part of. Without these activities, I certainly would not be the person I am today.</span></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>
